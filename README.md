# calculatorproj
A calculator that I have been working on and using for more improvement in my Python skills.
You can type the operator you want. The only supported operators are add, sub, mult, and truediv. Everything else in the works.
All operands are displayed in floats, just to make it easier on myself.

Feel free to add recommendations how I can improve. Thanks!
